        what is this website all about. It's about <br />"NOTHING"<br />
        <i>not the tech company</i> but literally about nothing, Nothing seems
        very empty but the presence of no matter thought or emotion is a
        wonderful experience. We all love it as of now i'm writing this code i'm
        experiencing a state of flow there are no thoughts just nothing <br />
        <em>let's embrace nothing!!</em>

      we all are happy in our lives, but i want to tell you something, happiness
      isn't real. Life is truly a suffering, the only thing which is fixed is
      death <em>painful to some liberating to others</em>

      so what can we do, we can live without fears, we can become strong,
      remember when you guys were infants crawling on grass was tough because
      you were not strong enough, similar to that life comes with pain points
      but if you are continuosly making yourself strong these pain points are
      not a threat so the point is to make your self strong and limit the powers
      of whatever life throws at you.
